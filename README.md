# Welcome to Markt (pronounced Market!)

## This is my chosen Capstone project for my Web Dev Bootcamp program at Brainstation.

Markt will be an app that brings small businesses closer to those in their community by becoming visible to consumers via local map functionality, displaying to consumers all of the (Markt-registered) businesses within a specified radius. Consumers can then choose to follow a business which will trigger the delivery of posts from the business to the consumer's personal feed. Businesses are free to promote their goods and services with the posts that will populate in their followers' feeds. A consumer clicking on a businesses in-app profile will also provide the consumer with walking or cycling directions to that nearby business.

The idea is for small businesses to get on the radar of nearby consumers who may not even know they exist. Perhaps a stay-at-home mom makes natural perfumes in her basement to sell at summer markets, only to have business dwindle in the off season, Markt will allow her to stay connected with a local audience and keep them interested with posts about her new products, promotions, or knowledge. Or perhaps a local coffee shop has the best baklavas this side of the Atlantic, but locals miss out because they only know of a nearby chain instead. You get the idea.

Phase 2 (or if there is time in phase 1!) will include a consumers ability to choose preferences in types of businesses, and recommendations will be offered accordingy. Additionally, an "I'm coming to get it" button will be added to businesses posts so that consumers can show their interest and intention to buy.

Phase 3 will build on the "I'm coming to get it" button in the form of a rating system. In that, if a consumer clicks this button and does not show up, perhaps repeatedly, the business can give them a negative ratings. Likewise if a business cannot deliver what it offered in a post, a consumer can leave a negative review. Conversely each type of user can express positive reviews to their conterparts if they choose. 

Based on the usage throughout the time of the first two phases, phase three may also include direct messaging functionality between consumers and businesses, or perhaps this will take the shape of comments, and comment threads on the exisiting post structure.

I plan to use Mapbox for my mapping functionality, Prisma for database management, and react and node for creating the front-end, and backend respectively.

## To Install Markt

### Steps

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
